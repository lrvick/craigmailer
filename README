WHAT IS CRAIGMAILER?

	A script to watch topics on craigslist for you, then forwards you all
	the posts as emails FROM the posters email addresses. All you need to do
	is just hit 'Reply' to anything that interests you, making responding to
	craigslist ads far less painful. No more copy/pasting.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Can watch any number of topics

 * Spoofs the posters email address so replies go directly to the poster

 * Easy to put prefix-topics to make it simple to filter ads to a separate
	 folder in your email client.

 * Trivial to hack for any good/evil you come up with.

NOTES

	If you do use this for evil, I am not responsible. If the outcome
	is particularly funny, by all means tell me about it.

	I pretty much just made this to stalk job listings on craigslist
	so I could snipe them with a real reply before anyone else. ;-)
